# [WIP] A Random Finite Set Approach for Dynamic Occupancy Grid Maps with Real-Time Application

A ROS(v1) wrapper for the [Dynamic Occupancy Grid](https://github.com/idlebear/dynamic-occupancy-grid-map), which implements [A Random Finite Set Approach for Dynamic Occupancy Grid Maps with Real-Time Application](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.02406).  

Initially targetting integration with the [CARLA](https://github.com/carla-simulator/) simulation environment.
